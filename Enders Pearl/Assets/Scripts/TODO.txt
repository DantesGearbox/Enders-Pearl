TODO:
- Make tiles into one big block to not get stuck

DONE:
- Fix the edge-jumping bug, steal from Level 1 game
- Only scale the visual of the sprite with velocity, not the collision box

Design decisions:
- Pearl is affected by gravity (consider size of design space, maybe combine)
- Have collectibles, either Mario style coins that you pick up all the time (casual), or Celeste strawberries (challenging)
- Pressing the throw button as soon as a pearl lands might provide some added feature to have more depth
- Releasing the throw button or pressing the throw button again, mid-air, might teleport you to the pearls current position
- Holding down the button before a throw might charge up the throw or have some bonus
- The pearl might have a specific range after which it starts being affected by gravity, but is unaffected before this range
- Throwing the pearl might propell you backwards
- Holding down the other mouse button might modify the throw
- There might be a whole different mechanic on the other mouse button
- Having time sensitive pick-ups might encourage the player to play faster for a short time
- Have a pearl that summons platforms
- Boomerang pearls, affected by gravity, but when you press the button again it starts flying directly towards the player
- Inspired by Angry Birds: Press again to make the pearl drop straight down, press again to straighten the curve

Design decisions
- A new pearl can only be thrown when the previous one is destroyed
- Jumping is mostly for vertical movement due to it's sharp and tall curve

Level Design pillars:
- The rule of 3
- Remember the arc

Rambling:
- Identify pillars of gameplay and switch through them for good pacing (Vetical jump, horizontal jump, pearl jump, other mechanics)
- Include mystique in levels by showing the door before the key, show a branch while it is still unavailable
- Flow is the product of fitting the right player skill to the right game difficulty curve
- Try to have depth within a mechanic, ex Darius/Aatrox deals more damage with the edge of their attacks
- A mechanic should fullfil a niche a not overlap too much, like weapons in a shooter
- The more mechanics there are, the smaller their niches will be, so much that new players won't notice the difference
- A challenge that can be solved easily can work well as a reward
- Having multiple ways through a level can allow for a kind of OR gating mechanic
